# Bernstein Vazirani Algorithm:
I have implemented the Bernstein Vazirani algorithm in Qiskit. The Bernstein Vazirani algorithm is one of the several algorithms that have proven that quantum computers surpass classical computers in certain domains. Although it is an algorithm with no applications thought of at the moment, this is the first step to surpass classical computers in certain aspects.
